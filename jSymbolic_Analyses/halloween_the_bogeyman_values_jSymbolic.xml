   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch</name>
      <description>Mean MIDI pitch value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch Class</name>
      <description>Mean pitch class value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. A value of 0 corresponds to a mean pitch class of C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer units from there (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the mean pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Pitch Class</name>
      <description>The pitch class that occurs most frequently compared to other pitch classes. A value of 0 corresponds to C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer untis (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the most common pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Variability</name>
      <description>Standard deviation of the MIDI pitches of all pitched notes in the piece. Provides a measure of how close the pitches as a whole are to the mean pitch.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Melodic Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the melodic interval histogram described above. Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 128 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches, bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone, bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones, etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as identical. Melodies are assumed to be contained within individual MIDI tracks and channels, so melodic intervals are found separately for each track and channel before being combined in this histogram. It is also assumed that there is only one melody at a time per MIDI channel (if multiple notes occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick on the same MIDI track and channel, then all notes but the first note on that tick are ignored). Other than this, all notes on the same track and the same channel are treated as if they are part of a single melody. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels (i.e. that they are each separately contained in their own track and channel). Only pitched notes are considered, so all notes on the unpitched MIDI Channel 10 are ignored.</description>
